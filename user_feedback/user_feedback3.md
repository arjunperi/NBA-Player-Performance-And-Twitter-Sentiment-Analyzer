## Usability Feeback 
- I think you should tell users to start at the create page.
- The home page was a nice intro
- Pretty easy to navigate and didn't see any glaring errors

## Styling
- Looks really crisp.

## General Comments
- It would have been cool to also see the tweets in addition to the sentiment score
- I would have liked to know more about how the sentiment analysis is done and what algorithms are used.
