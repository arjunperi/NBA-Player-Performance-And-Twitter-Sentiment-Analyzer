## Usability Feeback 
- Wow how did you get this logging in with google thing to work, super cool
- I love how you can add to the explore page and see what other people have added as well. 
- Why is there a lag when getting the twitter data? I was kind of just waiting there. 

## Styling
- I liked the light blue theme. 
- Why do the stats only take up part of the screen? You should fix it so they take up the whole width. 

## General Comments
- Liked the idea and the styling and features were all great. Try to reduce some of the lag.
