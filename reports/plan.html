    <h2 class = "center">Idea</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Rapid technological developments over the last few decades have ushered in the era of social media, where almost 
                all of our lives are influenced by the opinions and comments made public by those around us. Among those who are influenced
                most are professional atheletes, with rich online communities consitently debating and discussing their performance 
                both on and off the playing stage. One of the most active communities is that of NBA twitter, where praise is given, insults are thrown,
                and viral remarks are made that <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2716427-kevin-durant-responds-to-multiple-trash-talking-fans-on-twitter">
                warrant responses from the players themselves. </a> 
            </li>
            <li>
                It is often said that NBA players' lives are much different now than they were before due to the advent of social media, and my final project 
                aims to see how much of an impact online communities have on the lives and performances of NBA players.     
            </li>
            <li>
                There are a plethora of existing websites that provide statistic - lookup capabilities, but my website will take this one step further by combining 
                these statistics with sentiment analysis from the NBA twitter communities. This will enable users to view which players get the most
                attention online, how positive or negative this attention might be, and how it correlates to their on-court performance. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
<hr>
<div>
    <h2 class = "center">Scope</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            My website will enable users to search NBA players and display their statistics, as well as an analysis of the conversations surrounding them 
            on Twitter.
        </li>
        <li>
            My website will enable users to search NBA players and display their statistics, as well as an analysis of the conversations surrounding them 
            on Twitter.
        </li>
        <li>
            For each player, users can filter the analysis by date (e.g if the user knows of a date where the player had a bad 
            game and wants to see how the twitter community reacted or vice versa), by sentiment analysis threshholds (e.g if the 
            user wants to see how the worst/best day of twitter opinions affected their performance without knowing a specific date), or by 
            performance threshholds (e.g if the users want to see how the worst/best on court performances affected twitter opinions
            without knowing a specific date).
        </li>
        <li>
            In addition, users will be able to add players to their favorites list for quicker access. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Users will be able to display multiple users on the screen at once to enable comparisons. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The server will thus be responsible for loading player statistics and tweets regarding that player, as well performing 
            a sentiment analysis using AI.
        </li>
        <li>
            Optionally, I hope to allow for saving certain analyses (e.g the analyses shown for a certain date), provide some sort 
            of algorithm that gives a score or metric correlating the Twitter analysis to the player performance, and support analyses
            of ex-NBA players based on the current discussion about them on Twiter and showing how this might have affected their stats. Lastly, 
            I would like to display some sort of graph or visualization to show the aformentioned correlation.
        </li>
        <li>
            In terms of technologies, I plan on using Vue/Bootstrap Vue, either Firebase or MongoDB, the IBM Watson API, Twitter API,
            and balldontlie API.
        </li>

    <h2 class = "center">Data Sources</h2>
    <h4 class  = "center">Twitter API</h4>
    <div class="center">
        The Twitter API will be used to collect data on tweets surrounding each NBA player that the user selects. This API provides 
        data in JSON format, with easy-to-query object keys. Here is an example of a default Tweet object:

        </div>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h4 class = "center">IBM Watson API</h4>
    <div class = "center">
        The IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding API will be used to perform sentiment analysis on the Twitter data that is collected.
        This API provides data in JSON format, with a sentiment score and data on emotions, concepts, categories, and more. Here is an example
        of the JSON data that is returned:
        <div>

        </div>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h4 class = "center">nbasense API</h4>
    <div class = "center">
        The balldontlie API will be used to collect stats on NBA players. The data is updated every 10 minutes, and it also provides JSON 
        formatting. Here is an example of the JSON data that is returned:
        <img src="./plan_images/Screen Shot 2021-03-24 at 9.48.08 PM.png" alt="balldontlie API JSON Data Example">

    <div>    
    </div>
</div>
<hr>
<div>
    <h2 class = "center">Data Structure</h2>
    <div class = "center">
        My data structure will be supported by a Firebase or MongoDB database and will hold all the external data that is fetched along 
        with the website formulated data and user data such as favorites, saved statistics, etc. 
    </div>

    <h2 class = "center">Wireframe</h2>
    <div class = "center">
        Basic wirefame mockup that shows nav bar for user options, as well as rough draft of the player cards that will display stats
        along with sentiment analysis. As shown, users can search for players and display mutliple player cards on the screen at once
        for easy comparison. In addition, player cards have filtering options so users can see the data as they desire.
